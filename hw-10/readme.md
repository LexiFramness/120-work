# **Week 10 Assignment:** Functions and Arrays

[Mimi Sketch](https://lexiframness.github.io/120-work/hw-10)


I decided to take the portrait of my dog, Mimi, and combined it with the ball moving across the screen. I moved the original code of these two projects and made them into their own functions in my new assignment. I also added an array where three rectangles randomly changing colors, move down the right side of the screen.

# Problems
I did not run into any problems this week, that I wasn't able to solve myself, just by rereading through my code, and breaking down where the code was broken. I forgot to capitalize "myPos" which was causing issues for awhile, but once I noticed the lower case p, and corrected the mistake, things were working like they should.
