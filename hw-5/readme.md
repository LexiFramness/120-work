# **Week 5 Assignment:** Portrait or Monster Drawing

[Animation Sketch](https://lexiframness.github.io/120-work/hw-4)


I decided to try to animate my portrait of my dog, Mimi.

In order to complete this assignment, I need to be able to understand and use multiple different input parameters.

- function setup()
- function draw()
- createCanvas()
- translate()
- background()
- push()
- noStroke ()
- fill ()
- ellipse()
- triangle()
- pop()

# Problems
I only ran into a minor issue where my drawing would update locally, but after pushing to Github, the drawing was 4 or 5 steps behind where I currently was. I found that clearing my web browser cache fixed this issue. I also was unable to get the exact shades of color I wanted, but started to run out of time to really dig into color options, and decided for this assignment I would just stick to the basics like when setting the fill.
