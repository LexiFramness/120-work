# **Week 5 Assignment:** Portrait or Monster Drawing

[Animation Sketch](https://lexiframness.github.io/120-work/hw-5)


I decided to try to animate my portrait of my dog, Mimi.

In order to complete this assignment, I needed to be able to understand and use multiple different input parameters in addition to the ones I had learned last week. This week I learned:

- let
- textSize
- text
- var
- windowWidth
- windowHeight
- height
- width
- mouseX
- mouseY

# Problems
I was accidentally trying to create and set my variables while inside the setup function, this was crashing my code. Once I noticed my mistake I moved my variables outside of a function and my code worked like I wanted it to.
