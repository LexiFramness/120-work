# **Final Project:**

## Basic Idea

I want to try and create a basic game of pong, with a working counter showing lives remaining, as well as a counter showing points as the player acquires them. The paddle will be attached to the mouse and will be constricted to the lower part of the screen. I want to incorporate some sort of arcade style music in the background as well. I will have to research how to add music to my project. This version will be 1 player, and use the top of the screen to return the ball back towards the players paddle.

## Inspiration
I overheard my boyfriend and some of his friends talking about pong the other day, and I decided that would attempting to recreate a variation of that for my final project would be fun.

## Problems
The first real error I ran into with the project was forgetting to add the p5 sound library to my index.html file. so I couldn't get pass the preload function. Once I figured out that mistake I was able to move forward with the project.

# Current Work
I have already started looking into how to add music/sound to a project.
