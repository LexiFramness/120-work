# HW 7 | Describe then Alter the Bouncing Ball

## Description of What the Original Code is Doing

The original code created a ball that moves across a canvas. The first few lines of code create the ball. Next the canvas is created and given a background, this is done in the "setup" function. Next a draw loop is created, inside is the code creating the ball which moves diagonally across the canvas, leaving the old circle drawn, creating a trail across the canvas, as the circle moves along. Once the ball hits the edge of the canvas it bounces, and travels diagonally along its new path. Clicking the mouse changes the distance between the balls.


## How did you alter the sketch?

The first thing I did was change the canvas height from 400 to windowHeight. This way, the canvas just fills the users window completely. I also decided to set a frame rate of 17. Next I change the color of the background, along with the color of the ball I decided I didn't want the stroke of the ball so I removed that. I also changed the spacing between the balls once the mouse has been clicked. I also decided to make the ball smaller in size than the original had done.
