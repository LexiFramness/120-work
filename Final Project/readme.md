# **Final Project:** Final Project Proposal

## Basic Idea

I want to try and create a basic game of pong, with a working counter showing lives remaining, as well as a counter showing points as the player acquires them. The paddle will be attached to the mouse and will be constricted to the lower part of the screen. I want to incorporate some sort of arcade style music in the background as well. I will have to research how to add music to my project. I choose this for my final project because I wanted to try an incorporate things already learned from in class, and add some new knowledge of p5 to the project.

I plan to spend 1-2 hours a day working on the project until it is completed.

I have already started looking into how to add music to a project.
