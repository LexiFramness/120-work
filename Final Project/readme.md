# **Final Project:** Proposal

## Basic Idea

I want to try and create a basic game of pong, with a working counter showing lives remaining, as well as a counter showing points as the player acquires them. The paddle will be attached to the mouse and will be constricted to the lower part of the screen. I want to incorporate some sort of arcade style music in the background as well. I will have to research how to add music to my project.

## Inspiration
I overheard my boyfriend and some of his friends talking about pong the other day, and I decided that would attempting to recreate a variation of that for my final project would be fun.

## Schedule
I plan to spend 1-2 hours a day working on the project until it is completed.

# Current Work
I have already started looking into how to add music to a project.
