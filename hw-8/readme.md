# **Week 8 Assignment:** Really Wide Open Assignment

[Sketch](https://lexiframness.github.io/120-work/hw-8)


Since we were left to pretty much do whatever we wanted this week, I decided to take the code from the past few assignments, and mash them together a little bit. I made changes from what I originally submitted for each weeks code, and removed a lot of code. The big changes were making the ball randomly change color, and giving the stroke of my spinner a random color as well. I also moved the background around to prevent the spinner, and balls trail from being hidden.
