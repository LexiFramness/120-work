# **Week 6 Assignment:** Algorithmic Sketch

[Algorithmic Sketch](https://lexiframness.github.io/120-work/hw-6)


I decided to try to animate my portrait of my dog, Mimi,  but I quickly had to throw that idea out the window, it was way too hard. I ended up spending most of my time messing with random color generators.

In order to complete this assignment, I needed to be able to understand and use multiple different input parameters in addition to the ones I had learned last week. This week I learned about:

- abs()
- ceil()
- ceil()
- constrain()
- floor()
- pow()
- round()
- sq()
- sqrt()
- map()
- random()
- "+"
- "-"
- "*
- "%"


# Problems
This was just overall challenging, math truly is the absolute worst. I wanted to make the two circles on either side of the circle created by the cursor rotate around the center circle, but couldn't figure out how to make that happen, so I decided to create some fixed spinning rectangles to spice things up a little.
