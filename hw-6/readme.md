# **Week 6 Assignment:** Algorithmic Sketch

[Algorithmic Sketch](https://lexiframness.github.io/120-work/hw-6)


I decided to try to animate my portrait of my dog, Mimi.

In order to complete this assignment, I needed to be able to understand and use multiple different input parameters in addition to the ones I had learned last week. This week I learned about:

- abs()
- ceil()
- ceil()
- constrain()
- floor()
- pow()
- round()
- sq()
- sqrt()
- map()
- random()
- "+
- "-"
- "*
- "%"


# Problems
